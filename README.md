## **How To Use This Repo**

You're starting at the right place! This file contains general resources and links to pages on specific concepts. 

For each concept, you find resources and practice problems on the concept. Some resources address multiple concepts.

You also find solutions to the practice problems solved by others in the community.

## **How To Contribute**

We'd like to encourage you to solve the practice problems after learning each concept and then send us a pull request with your working solution in any language.

If you also solved an interesting problem related to any concept, or you found a helpful resource, feel free to send us a pull request of it. 

If you've never contributed to open-source before, let this be your first contribution! [Here's a step-by-step reference](https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/) to contributing.

After that, you can check the guidelines on how to add your solutions [here](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to the series

If you are a more advanced coder, we would welcome your help reviewing PRs of code solutions and providing helpful feedback on best practices.
