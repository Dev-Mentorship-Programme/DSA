Count of substrings that start and end with 1 in given Binary String

Given a binary string s, the task is to count all substrings that start and end with the character '1'. 
A valid substring must have both its first and last characters as '1', and can include one or more number of characters in between.

Examples:

Input: s = "00100101"
Output: 3
Explanation: Valid substrings are "1001", "100101", and "101", all starting and ending with '1'.

Input: s = "1001"
Output: 1
Explanation: Only one valid substring: "1001", which starts and ends with '1'.

Input: s = "111"
Output: 3
Explanation: Valid substrings are "11" (first and second), "11" (second and third), and "111" (entire string).
